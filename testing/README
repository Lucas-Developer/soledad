Soledad Tests
=============

This folder contains all tests for Soledad client and server.

Dependency on CouchDB
---------------------

Currently, some tests depend on availability of a CouchDB server. You can pass
a custom couchdb url by using the --couch-url option when running tox (or
pytest), like this:

  tox -- --couch-url http://couch_host:5984

Tests that depend on couchdb are marked as such with the 'needs_couch' pytest
marker. You can skip them by avoiding tests with that marker:

  tox -- -m 'not needs_couch'

In the future we want to isolate all tests that need couch as integration
tests, and use mocks everywhere else.
